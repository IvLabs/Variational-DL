## Conditional GAN
Conditional GAN is an extension of DCGAN. DCGAN is able to generate good quality images but the problem with them is that they generate random plausible examples of a given dataset. It is difficult to control the type of images generated by the network. 

Conditional GAN avoids this problem. Conditional GAN is a type of GAN that involves the conditional generation of images by a generator model. It utilises the labels of the data and generates images of a particular class of labels.

The above figure shows how a CGAN differs from normal GAN.

The model is trained on CIFAR-10 dataset. To run the code, Open Terminal and navigate to this directory and run
```
python test.py
```
